# Compiler Error C2857
'#include' statement specified with the /Ycfilename command-line option was not found in the source file  
  
 The [/Yc](../buildref/-yc--create-precompiled-header-file-.md) option specifies the name of an include file that is not included in the source file being compiled.  
  
 This error can be caused by a `#include` statement in a conditional compilation block that is not compiled.
